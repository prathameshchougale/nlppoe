Automatic summarization is the process of shortening a set of data
computationally,
to create a subset (a summary) that represents the most important or
relevant information
within the original content. In addition to text, images and videos
can also be summarized.
Text summarization finds the most informative sentences in a document;
various algorithms
exist to do this, including statistical, linguistic, and machine
learning approaches.
The Gensim library in Python provides a simple implementation of text
summarization
based
